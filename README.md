## About the project

This is a functioning front-end of an online store. You are able to add products from a catalogue and product pages to a seperate cart page. You are also able to apply a promo
code for a discount as well as shipping costs to your total. Users are alerted to their basket total when adding new products to their cart. When the user is happy to "checkout",
they are given a unique refernce number for their order.
