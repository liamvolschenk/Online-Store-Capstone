    <h4 class="text-center">Mike Froome</h4>

    <p style="font-size: 18px" class="text-center">Mike is about as real of a cyclist as they come. Born in Kenya,
        raised in South Africa and now residing in the UK. A cyclist by profession, he has raced on the world cycling
        tour for some of the most prestigious teams since he was a teenager, oh did we mention that he won the Tour De
        France FOUR times. We think its safe to say that he knows his way around a bike, he is at the helm of the shop
        making sure that everything happens just as its supposed to. Need some adive on bearings? ask Mike. Need some
        help choosing a bottom bracket? speak to Mike. He will always give you his best and honest opinion.</p>

        bicycle all around the world, through many conditions and circumstances. Lets just say that he has broken a lot
        of gear, so that you dont have to, he knows what works and what doesn't. Pop in for a coffee and a chat with
        Simon and he will guide you to what will best suit you and your needs.</p>
